##Status Update

1. We have implemented a seam-carving (like) algorithm on GTX 750 which is about 8x faster than a baseline CPU implementation of the same for average cases.

2. We are still working on finding an optimal criterion for switching between seamcarving and scaling

3. We will shortly update the following graphs
 

    3.1 GPU-Speed up vs no of seams removed (width reduced) for a given resolution ( average figures)
    
    3.2 GPU-Speed up vs the (width ) size of the image for a given number of seams to be removed.
    
    3.3 A surface plot combining above two with more data points for completeness
